A team project to develop a game that helps in the appreciation of prioritization

Here's how it works.

The game goes like this:
 - a team-master creates a set of questions
 - each player in the team gets to go through the questions independently
 - for each question, the player is given a set number of "points"
 - the player has to distribute all his points, not less, not more, across the options provided in the question
 
 
Example:
The question may be constructed as:
Q1 : 10 points; Car that is fast  vs Car that is non-polluting

Player might select 7 points to fast and 3 points to non-polluting. 




The app allows you to:
 - create a new team
 - joing a team by accepting an invitation to join the team
 - send an invitation to someone to join your team, by sending them a URL using your channel of choice (outside the App)
 - see the teams you're playing in
 - for each team, see your choices and how you compare to others in your team
 - if the team was marked as "public data" then allow your team's results to be aggregated for a public comparison
 - see your team's results against the public's
